## Introduction

Our hotel reservation application utilizes cutting-edge technologies, including React, Sass, and Cloudinary, to provide an exceptional user experience. Below, we explain how to get started using it.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Sass:** A CSS preprocessor that facilitates styling and organization of the application's design.
- **Cloudinary:** A cloud media management platform used for image storage and manipulation.
- **Cypress:** Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It allows developers to write and run tests that simulate user interactions within a web application, making it easier to ensure that the application functions correctly.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In the context of web applications, JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization. They consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.

- **Stripe (Payment Gateway):** Stripe is a widely used payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept online payments. It provides a simple way to handle payments, subscriptions, and manage financial transactions securely.

- **Leaflet:** Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for rendering interactive maps in web applications. It's lightweight, flexible, and provides a wide range of options for customizing maps and adding various layers, markers, and interactions.

- **React Router Dom:** React Router Dom is a library for routing in React applications. It enables developers to create dynamic, single-page applications with multiple views or pages, allowing users to navigate between different parts of the application.

- **Axios:** Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests from a web application to a server or external API. It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests and handling responses.

- **ESLint:** ESLint is a popular JavaScript linting tool that helps developers identify and fix code issues, enforce coding standards, and maintain code quality and consistency.

- **Auth0:** Auth0 is an identity and access management platform that provides authentication and authorization services for web and mobile applications. It simplifies user authentication, including social logins, single sign-on, and user management.
- **SendGrid:** is a cloud-based email delivery and management service that provides a platform for sending and receiving emails, as well as email automation and analytics. It allows developers to integrate email functionality into their applications and services, ensuring reliable email delivery and tracking of email engagement. SendGrid also offers features such as email templates, email scheduling, and reporting, making it a valuable tool for businesses and developers to manage their email communication effectively.
